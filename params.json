  "body": "## Titanic Survival Exploration\r\n\r\n### Install\r\n\r\nThis project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries installed:\r\n\r\n- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\r\n- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)\r\n- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)\r\n- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\r\n\r\nYou will also need to have software installed to run and execute an [iPython Notebook](http://ipython.org/notebook.html)\r\n\r\nI recommend to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads), a pre-packaged Python distribution that contains all of the necessary libraries and software for this project.\r\n\r\n### Code\r\n\r\nTemplate code is provided in the notebook `titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb` notebook file. Additional supporting code can be found in `titanic_visualizations.py`. While some code has already been implemented to get you started, you will need to implement additional functionality when requested to successfully complete the project.\r\n\r\n### Run\r\n\r\nIn a terminal or command window, navigate to the top-level project directory `titanic_survival_exploration/` (that contains this README) and run **one** of the following commands:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\njupyter notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb\r\n```\r\nor\r\n```bash\r\nipython notebook titanic_survival_exploration.ipynb\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis will open the iPython Notebook software and project file in your web browser.\r\n\r\n## Data\r\n\r\nThe dataset used in this project is included as `titanic_data.csv`. This dataset is provided by Udacity and contains the following attributes:\r\n\r\n- `survival` : Survival (0 = No; 1 = Yes)\r\n- `pclass` : Passenger Class (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd)\r\n- `name` : Name\r\n- `sex` : Sex\r\n- `age` : Age\r\n- `sibsp` : Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard\r\n- `parch` : Number of Parents/Children Aboard\r\n- `ticket` : Ticket Number\r\n- `fare` : Passenger Fare\r\n- `cabin` : Cabin\r\n- `embarked` : Port of Embarkation (C = Cherbourg; Q = Queenstown; S = Southampton)\r\n# titanic_survival_exploration\r\n",
